    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>Welcome. This website was created because I believe that everyone deserves to have a little cat content in their lives, so I will be briefly providing some.</p>
    <br>
    <p> On this page, we will be discussing: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What a cat is</li>
      <li>Why you should get a cat</li>
      <li>Communicating with cats</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also view <a href="#information">my information</a> at the bottom of the page.</p>

    <h2>So, what exactly is a cat?</h2>
    <p>In the most basic terms, these (typically) furry and adorable felines are amazing pets, and may otherwise be seen roaming around in the streets. Each cat is very different; researching breeds can only go so far in determining what your cat will be like. It may be the type to ruthlessly knock your most prized possessions onto the floor, never giving it a second thought... But it could also be the type to come lay next to you and give you all the emotional support you need as you go throughout your day. Will you be one of the lucky few who find themselves a cuddly cat that enjoys your presence?</p>
    <p>Ultimately, it's hard to say.</p>
  </div>
  
  
  <h2>Why should you get a cat?</h2> 
  <p>They're cute.</p>
  <p>And maybe you'll learn to like the claw marks on your furniture.</p>

  
  <h2>Communicating with cats</h2>
  <p>A <em>meow</em> (noun) is the predominant sound used in the preferred language of the cat species. This can be used to express an extensive variety of emotions and thoughts. (i.e. "Feed me treats," "I'm angry with you," "I'm dissapointed with you," "I'm looking down on you," "I've decided to interupt whatever you're doing by clawing at your door," "I'M AWAKE AT 3AM SO YOU ARE TOO," etc.)</p>
  <p>Learn what your cat is telling you and you may have a chance of them tolerating you <strong>slightly</strong> more.</p>
