    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>I believe that everyone deserves to have some cat content in their lives, and so I will be briefly providing some.</p>
    <br>
    <p> On this page, we will be discussing: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What a cat is</li>
      <li>Why you should get a cat</li>
      <li>Communicating with cats</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can also view <a href="#information">my information</a> at the bottom of the page.</p>

    <h2>So, what exactly is a cat?</h2>
    <p>In the most basic terms, these (typically) furry and adorable felines are amazing pets, and may otherwise be seen roaming the streets. Each cat is very different; researching breeds can only go so far in determining what your cat will be like. It may be the Will you be one of the lucky few who find themselves a cuddly cat that enjoys their presence?</p>
    <p>Ultimately, it's hard to say.</p>
  </div>
  
  <br>
  
  <h2>Why should you get a cat?</h2> 
  <p>They're cute.</p>
  <p>And maybe you'll learn to like the claw marks on your furniture.</p>

  <br>
  
  <h2>Communicating with cats</h2>
  <p>A <em>meow</em> (noun) is the predominant sound used in the preferred language of the cat species. This can be used to express an extensive variety of emotions and thoughts. (i.e. "Feed me treats," "I'm angry with you," "I'm dissapointed with you," "I'm looking down on you," "I've decided to interupt whatever you're doing by clawing at your door," "I'M AWAKE AT 3AM SO YOU ARE TOO," etc.)</p>
  <p>Learn what your cat is telling you and you may have a chance of them tolerating you <strong>slightly</strong> more.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>That is all of the content that is here for now. Take a look at a few more picture before you go.</p>
